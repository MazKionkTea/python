You can also enable SMB on Windows 10 from PowerShell. Open PowerShell with admin rights. 
If you’d like to check whether or not SMB is already enabled, run the command below.

	Get-SmbServerConfiguration | Select EnableSMB2Protocol

If the command returns ‘False’, then you need to enable SMB. Run the command below to enable it.

	Set-SmbServerConfiguration -EnableSMB2Protocol $true

If you want to disable SMB, you can use this command.

	Set-SmbServerConfiguration -EnableSMB2Protocol $false

If you’re unfamiliar with SMB, enabling the feature is really just the first step to setting it up. 
You will likely have a bit of work ahead of you. 
If you’re prompted for a port for your Windows 10 system at any point, try 445 or 139.
